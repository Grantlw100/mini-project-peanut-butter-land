# Peanut Butter Land
## Description
This project was completed as a course requirement for the UCF-coding bootcamp. It is designed for the simple purpose of showcasing skills.
  I understand it is not a serious document and i understand that this may affect how i am viewed by professional organizations; HOWEVER, in
a world of consistent turmoil, chaos, and uproar fun and happiness should always be an alternative means of showcasing ones skills.
Rest assured, when in a professional setting, i will conduct myself professionally. Welcome to peanut butter land .html.
