    <p class="p">Founded on April 18th in the lovely year of 1987 by Mr.Geraldo Pierre Fitzgerald-Smythe,
            the long lost twin of the well known Bartholomew Richard Fitzgerald Smith, discovered this
            beautiful yet abandoned land and decided to fill it with...
    </p>

    <p class="peanuty-goodness">
            PEANUTY GOODNESS!!!
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        Following a very brief feud with the remaining locals, Mr.Peanutty finalized the creation of this beautiful nation
        and declared it a sovereign state. Since then we have worked tirelessly to ensure a safe, healthy,and homestyle environment
        that is fun for the entire family.
